# Hackathon-Recorder
Hackathon Recorder is a simple React project built as part of my learning journey.
It helped me understand and practice important React concepts like using hooks, passing props, and managing component-based architecture.
🚀 About the Project

This project allows users to record hackathon details such as event name, date, and project information.
It’s mainly designed to explore:

React component structure

useState and useEffect hooks

Passing data through props

Rendering dynamic lists using .map()
